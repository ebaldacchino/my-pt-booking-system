				<Title>Make exercise work for you</Title>
				<Text>
					I get really annoyed seeing how many people engage in a trainer. They
					work their ass off, sweat day in, day out and don&apos;t see the results
					they want. The coach gives you a workout. However, there&apos;s no
					structure to the other 23 hours of your day. With everyone I train, I
					don&apos;t give them a 45 minute workout, take their money and move onto
					the next one. I invest in them. I provide the lifestyle structure,
					backed by the science they need to actually get their results, and
					implement effective workouts that are goal oriented.

					My knowledge is vast. I am forever learning and keeping up to date
					with the latest research in exercise science. With this, Iâ€™m never too
					proud to change strategy as needed. The objective is to really find
					what works for you. This might take time. It will give you something
					that works for you for life.

					Hi. My name is Maseh Nuristani. A former world title holder in
					kickboxing, I sought Eddy&apos;s services when I was at a low point of my
					career. Coming off a loss for the Australian title, I suffered a lot
					of injuries and seriously considered retirement.

					I stepped away from the sport and ran through a 4 month strength and
					conditioning program with Eddy. I came back to training camp with zero
					injuries and significant improvements in strength, speed and power.
					Thanks to Eddy&apos;s training, I was able to perform at a completely
					different level in my next fight, winning the Commonwealth title.

					I continued to use Eddy&apos;s programming throughout my career, and
					couldn&apos;t recommend him highly enough.
